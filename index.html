                    Since the summer of my freshman year of highschool, I have worked at a camp run by the Howard Area Community Center where I taught underprivileged kids the basics of coding.
                    The four summers that I have spent there so far have really influenced how I feel about the power of teaching others how to program.

                   Working with Chicago CRED has been my favorite work opportunity so far.
                    I worked with CRED to teach programming to recently incarcerated young men in order to prepare them for a job in web development or get them into a programming boot camp.
                    I regrettably had to leave CRED to focus on college and completing my school work but hopefully will work with them again in the future.

                    I've always been drawn to the overlap between design and development.
                    My skills are broad: from ux to design, front end to back end development.
                    I enjoy each aspect, and love building sites & mobile apps from start to finish, for clients all over the world.

                    While I do not have an instagram myself, I am quite adept in social media management. In the past I have ran ad campaigns on both facebook and instagram as well as created and curated content to pull maximum engagement.
